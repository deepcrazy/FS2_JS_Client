    <h4>Random and Hilarious Text message conversation</h4>

    <p>Some people send the most random text messages about the most random things. Often, for the recipient, getting
        one of these strange texts can be nothing short of hilarious! You've probably received something similar to one
        of these odd, yet funny, texts before. If you did, you most likely took a screenshot of the conversation so you
        could show it to all your friends at a later time and have a good laugh!</p>
